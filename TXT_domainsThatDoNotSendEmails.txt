SPF
---
SPF records can be formatted to protect domains against attempted phishing attacks by 
rejecting any emails sent from the domain. To do so, an SPF record must use the following format.

Type Name            Content        TTL
TXT  example.com     v=spf1 -all    Auto


*Note, SPF records are set directly on the domain itself, meaning they do not require a special 
subdomain.

Here is what the individual components of this record mean:

v=spf1 lets the server know that the record contains an SPF policy. All SPF records must begin 
with this component. The indicator -all tells the server what to do with non-compliant emails 
or any senders that are not explicitly listed in the SPF record. With this type of SPF record, 
no IP addresses or domains are allowed, so -all states that all non-compliant emails will be 
rejected. For this type of record, all emails are considered non-compliant because there are 
no accepted IP addresses or domains.



DKIM
----
DKIM records protect domains by ensuring emails were actually authorized by the sender using 
a public key and a private key. DKIM records store the public key that the email server then 
uses to authenticate that the email signature was authorized by the sender. For domains that 
do not send emails, the DKIM record should be configured without an associated public key. 
Below is an example:

Type Name                      Content        TTL
TXT  *._domainkey.example.com	 v=DKIM1; p=    Auto

*._domainkey.example.com is the specialized name for the DKIM record (where “example.com” 
should be replaced with your domain). In this example, the asterisk (referred to as the 
wildcard) is being used as the selector, which is a specialized value that the email service 
provider generates and uses for the domain. The selector is part of the DKIM header and the 
email server uses it to perform the DKIM lookup in the DNS. The wildcard covers all possible 
values for the selector.

TXT indicates the DNS record type.
v=DKIM1 sets the version number and tells the server that this record references a DKIM policy.
The p value helps authenticate emails by tying a signature to its public key. In this DKIM 
record, the p value should be empty because there is no signature/public key to tie back to.


DMARC
-----
DMARC policies can also help protect domains that do not send emails by rejecting all emails 
that fail SPF and DKIM. In this case, all emails sent from a domain not configured to send 
emails would fail SPF and DKIM checks. Below is an example of how to format a policy this way:

Type Name                Content                                      TTL
TXT  _dmarc.example.com  v=DMARC1;p=reject;sp=reject;adkim=s;aspf=s   Auto

The name field ensures that the record is set on the subdomain called _dmarc.example.com, 
which is required for DMARC policies.
TXT indicates the DNS record type.
v=DMARC1 tells the server that this DNS record contains a DMARC policy.
p=reject indicates that email servers should reject emails that fail DKIM and SPF checks.
adkim=s represents something called the alignment mode. In this case, the alignment mode 
is set to “s” for strict. Strict alignment mode means that the server of the email domain 
that contains the DMARC record must exactly match the domain in the From header of the email. 
If it does not, the DKIM check fails.
aspf=s serves the same purpose as adkim=s, but for SPF alignment.
